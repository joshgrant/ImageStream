# ImageStream
A macOS tool for viewing photos in rapid succession.

This includes a way to analyze faces so that the faces are centered in the window. You can turn off "analyze faces" and just stream non-face photos as well.

Hints:

* Zoom in: scroll up
* Zoom out: scroll down
* Move photo up: =
* Move photo down: -
* Open preferences to see some options
* You can drag and drop a folder of images (png, jp(e)g, and webp only at the moment)
* Or, you can use "Open" from the menu

Bugs:

* If "anaylze faces" is not checked after loading photos, the app will crash if it's checked.
* Needs to turn off "hide non-face photos" when "center on face" is not checked
* There seems to be a number of images that is too many (didn't encounter this issue before) and it won't load.
* Sometimes faces aren't aligned properly. Weird.

Future Features:

* Tests
* Rotating faces
* Exporting options
* Loading directly from photos app.
